      <h3>About Tonight Pass</h3>
      <p>
        {`I often go out to nightclubs and parties, and I have seen that this world is not very technologically advanced. Most companies only think about pre-selling tickets for events, but in reality the organization of a party is much more complex.
Tonight Pass simplifies the whole organization: find your teams and DJs, create your parties, promote and sell in presale or on the spot, pay in groups, provide self-service kiosks and reduce your queues, set up loyalty programs, at the end collect authentic reviews and allow your customers to stay in touch with each other and with you.`}

Moreover until today we have not studied the possibility of raising funds to accelerate our development but we are open to anyone who would like to help us!"
